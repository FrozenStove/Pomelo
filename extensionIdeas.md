Ways to improve and extend this concept:

1. add a SQL database connection in order to store all of the transactions and datum
2. SQL database for users in order to have them be able to login and stuff
3. add email reminders of upcoming due dates or if pending balances are too old
4. at the end of every month, summarize all of the transactions to create an actual balance due, not just a running balance.
5. automatically apply interest daily for any balances past due
6. add encryption to users when logging in
7. add oauth support
